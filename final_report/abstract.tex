In this work, we implement a interactive character animation system based on Motion Graph~\cite{kovar2002}.
The idea of the work is based on the fighting game: the virtual character can perform several actions 
consecutively and seamlessly. 
The fighting combo skill is a key factor for playing a fighting game smoothly.
Referring to~\cite{kovar2002}, given a set of motion capture files, the system automatically 
generate a directed graph to concatenate motion and generate transition between 
two motion clips.
By walking on the graph, the character can easily generate a smooth animation 
based on user's command.
We demonstrated our system in a real-time , interactive way to control the 
virtual character.
