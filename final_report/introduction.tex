%introduce why it's important
Fighting games are very popular since the smooth animation and the energetic of martial arts. 
exaggerate  fancy skill


%fighting game by motion capture
however, motion capture is limited in 

If we can't get the appropriate or desired motion, the virtual character may not 
to perform some actions smoothly.


%motion graph successfully
generate transition between two motion clips. 

Actually, creating transition between two motion is a hard animation problem.

%what we've done
In this paper, we implemented the motion graph from [ref].
The idea of motion graph is to find the transition points between two clips, 
whose poses are similar. 
With the detecting algorithm, we can automatically find the transition points 
and reliably generate the transition with certain blending techniques.


%the experiment result
The result shows in Section4. We collect XX motion capture files from CMU motion 
capture library website. The 


% the following paper organization:
the following of this paper is organised  as follows.
In Section 2 we describe related work. In Section 3 we describe how a motion
graph is constructed from a database of motion capture. 

InSection 4 we set forth a general framework for extracting motion from the
motion graph that meets user specifications. 

Section 5 discusses the specific problem of generating movements along a path and how
it is handled in our framework. We conclude in Section 6 with a
discussion of the scalability of our app
